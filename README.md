# syncthing-conflict-resolver

Traverses a specified path for syncthing conflict files. Replaces the current active file with the newest conflicting file unless you specify --dry-run. No backups are made. Sanity checks are practically non-existant. If you're looking for something smart, this isn't it. Use at your own risk.
